# Git Workflow Rules

## Branch Protection

- NEVER commit directly to main/master branch
- Always create a feature branch using `/start-work` skill
- Branch names are auto-generated by Linear - never create manually

## Worktree Workflow

1. Use `/start-work` to create isolated worktree
2. Work in the worktree directory
3. Create PR when ready
4. Worktree is automatically linked to Linear issue
